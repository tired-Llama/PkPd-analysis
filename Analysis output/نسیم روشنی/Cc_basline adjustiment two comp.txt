DESCRIPTION:
The administration is via a bolus.
The PK model has a central compartment (volume V), a peripheral compartment (rate of transfer to and from k12 and k21), and a linear elimination (elimination rate k).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V, k, k12, k21, Cc_baseline}

PK:
; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(V, k, k12, k21)

; Adding baseline concentration
Cc_with_baseline = Cc + Cc_baseline

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc_with_baseline}
